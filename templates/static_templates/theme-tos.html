  <h1>Terms of Service for UNC Online Courses</h1>

  <p>The MOOCs on this site are created and run by the University of North Carolina (UNC) in partnership with The SAS Institute (SAS).  UNC is responsible for administration of the MOOC site.</p>
  <p><strong>Participation Requirements</strong></p>
  <p>Your participation in a UNC MOOC signifies your agreement to the Terms of Use and Honor Code.  You represent and agree that you are not misrepresenting your identity, that you are no younger than 13 years old, and that if you are a minor, you have permission from your parent or guardian to participate.  You understand and agree that participation in a UNC MOOC is not enrollment as a student at any UNC institution and no academic credit will be conferred.   If you do not agree, you may not participate in the course</p>
  <p id="privacy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>We respect your privacy. Personal information such as your name, address and e-mail is obtained only when voluntarily submitted.  Any information you provide will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of the MOOC project. We will use your contact information only for the MOOC activities and to send you information about other related resources and professional development opportunities. We may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional interests and experiences so that we can tailor portions of this MOOC to align with participant’ needs. Providing this information is optional.</p>
  <p id="privacy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>All MOOCs on this site are open and there is no cost for participation.  Funding to develop and run the course has been provided by UNC and SAS. </p>
  <p id="privacy"><strong>Research Use</strong></p>
  <p>UNC and SAS may conduct research about the courses intended to improve future MOOC offerings and contribute knowledge in the field. This research will involve analyzing patterns about site usage and user-submitted resources and comments. You may also be asked if you are willing to respond to survey questions or be interviewed for the research. Such participation is voluntary, and individual participants will not be identified.  Reasonable efforts will be made to avoid including information that could be connected to any individual in all research reports.</p>
  <p id="privacy"><strong>Posted information is not confidential</strong></p>
  <p>Comments you post in discussion forums are public and open to all participants.  Thus we cannot ensure confidentiality of anything posted anywhere on the MOOC site.  Since the MOOC is open to everyone, many participants will have access to the site. Avoid posting information that you do not consider to be public.  By posting your content, you acknowledge that your content may be a public record under the North Carolina Public Records Law.</p>
  <p id="privacy"><strong>You are responsible for information you submit</strong></p>
  <p>You are solely responsible for content you submit to this course and for the consequences of your submissions.  You agree to not submit any information that might violate others’ copyright or proprietary rights. By posting content you warrant and represent that you either own or otherwise control all of the rights to that content, including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input or submit the content, or that your use of the content is a protected fair use. You agree that you believe that all statements made about other individuals are true and that you will not knowingly provide material and misleading false information. You represent and warrant also that the content you supply does not violate these terms, and that you will indemnify and hold The UNC and SAS harmless for any and all claims resulting from content you supply. For materials you create, we ask that you voluntarily designate the materials as being under a Creative Commons license that allows others to use the materials for non-commercial purposes.  Unless you specify otherwise, any and all works of authorship copyrightable by you and posted by you are submitted under the terms of an  Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons Public License. Under this license, you permit anyone to copy, distribute, display and perform your content, royalty-free, on the condition that they credit you as the content creator each time they do so. You also permit others to distribute derivative works of your content, but only if they do so under the same Attribution-ShareAlike license that governs your original Content.</p>
    <p>UNC and SAS will not permit infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights.  If any content infringes on another&quot;s intellectual property rights, it will be removed as soon as we are aware of it. We reserve the right to remove any content without prior notice.
    </p>
    <p id="privacy"><strong>Use of information you submit.</strong></p>
    <p>You retain all of your ownership rights in your content. However, by submitting content to a MOOC, you hereby grant UNC and SAS a non-exclusive, royalty-free, license to use, reproduce, distribute, and display the content in connection with the MOOC. You also hereby grant each participant in the MOOC a non-exclusive license to access your content through the community, and to use, reproduce, distribute, and display such content. You agree that you are not entitled to receive any compensation for any content submitted to the course.
    </p>
    <p id="privacy"><strong>Appropriate use.</strong></p>
    <p>The purpose of these courses is to support the professional development of the participants.  UNC encourages courtesy, respect, and civility in its community and in its activities.  UNC requests that you act accordingly.   Participants agree that all information and interactions will be toward that goal, and that all interactions will be conducted in a professional manner respectful of the other participants. You also agree that you will not use the courses to market, advertise or sell any commercial products. UNC maintains the right, at its sole discretion, to remove, without notice, any materials or comments we deem inappropriate and to withdraw access to the site from of anyone we consider to have violated the appropriate use of the site.  Your participation is subject to all applicable University of North Carolina Board of Governors policies and local, state, and federal law.
    </p>
    <p id="privacy"><strong>Password protection. </strong></p>    
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that any user name, login code, identifier or password is confidential information. You are responsible for any use of your username, user ID, login and &#x2F; or password. You agree to notify the site administrator immediately of any unauthorized use of any password or any other breach of security of which you are aware.</p>
    <p id="privacy"><strong>Links to Third Party Websites.</strong></p>   
    <p>Within the site, there are links to websites and other resources operated by third parties. Such links are provided solely as a convenience to participants. Neither UNC nor SAS controls such websites, and we are not responsible for the contents, or products, services or other content offered through such websites.
